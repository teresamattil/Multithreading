# Multithreading
Concurrent multi-threaded system that calculates the cost of using the machines in a processing center.
This practice asked to design and implement, in C language and over the UNIX/Linux Operating System, the development of a cost calculation system for the use of machines in a computation center. The program has access to a file with the types of machines it wants to use, and the time (in minutes) of use of each one (input file), which will be passed as a parameter. The system must provide the user with the budget for the use of these resources (output).
